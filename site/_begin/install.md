## On your local Machine

If you want to compile and run Terra code on your local machine, like you do with `gcc`, you need to first install it. Then you can do stuff like:

```
$ terra main.t
$ ./main
``` 

For that, here are the places you need to delve into:

> Install a binary of the latest version for your platform

The binary releases can be found [here](https://github.com/terralang/terra/releases). Consult also [here](https://github.com/terralang/terra#installing-terra).
> Build from the source

  Consult [here](https://github.com/terralang/terra#building-terra) to build Terra from the source.

## Replit.com

You can create an account on Replit.com and fork the [Terra REPL template](https://replit.com/@terralang/terra#main.t) to run Terra code easily. I will also use this option in these notes to share my Terra REPLs so that you can run example code more easily. If you are going with this option, make sure to get yourself familiarized with _replit.com_ a little bit. It is actually a fantastic tool to hack on stuff.
