Documentation for Terra is there but scarce. Here I will collect all the resources I find.

Main page gives a very long overview of the language, you need to check this.

Getting Started page acts like a tutorial.

You have the API reference to dig a little bit deeper.

Note that none of the documentation is exhaustive and complete. There will be many lacking parts. One reason to write these notes is to fill in those gaps anyways. But if you can't find something, another good option is to search the GitHub Terra repository itself for example code. _tests_ folder contain quite a lot of code for various use cases.
